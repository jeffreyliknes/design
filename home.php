				<span class="red-website"><a href="https://redacademy.com/vancouver/">RED Academy</a></span>, a technology and design school with a
				agency-style environment that focuses on real client projects that focuses on real client projects in UX/UI design, web development & digital marketing.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<p> RED puts emphasis on working with real clients and moving away from classic teaching styles and curriculum. 
					This in return, allows the students to get a real taste of how the industry operates.  
				</p>	
				<br>
				<p>
					I graduated RED in the development program and couldn’t recommend the school more. 
					The industry is changing very rapidly and businesses are expecting development that is user friendly and responsive 
					on a wide range of devices. I have the skills to design tasteful interfaces to create a easy to use environment while also letting the user find everything they need.
				</p>
				<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Responsive HTML/CSS</li>
						<li>JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, and other frameworks)</li>
						<li>PHP</li>
						<li>Performance</li>
						<li>Animation</li>
						<li>Modern best practices</li>
						<li>Git (command line)</li>
						<li>WordPress</li>
					</ul>
				<br>
				<p>
					I have experience with Object-Oriented Programming, AJAX, JSON, and API’s. As well as, WP custom post loops,
					plug-in development, and WP security.
					I strive to make responsive front-end development to match the high-end quality of a company’s product.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>I attended the school for 3 months and learned proper practices, as well as, how to teach myself and where to
					get started. In the 3 months, my group and I were assigned a company to develop a website imagined by a UX 
					team in a different program. Together we built and presented a fully functioning website for kids to host their 
					newly created online games.
				</p>
				<p>As of now, I’m learning React.js and sharpening my Vanilla javascript practices.</p>

				<p>Travel</p>
				<br>
				<p>One of my passions is travelling. I love to explore and learn as much as I can about new cultures. My recent 
					trip took me through 
					7 countries in South-East Asia in 5 months.
				</p>	
				<br>	
				<p> Asia has so much to offer, from gorgeous beaches to bustling cities. Among my favourite places is Vietnam. 
					The culture of Vietnam is unparalleled and the people will go out of their way to show you what the country has 
					to offer. In Vietnam I bought a (cheap) motorcycle that took me most of the way through the country - before catching fire. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Modern cities, like Singapore, re-defined how I view the design of a city-environment aspect. City developers in
				   Singapore are incorporating nature by combining buildings with a rainforest-style architecture that is tasteful and 
				   functionable. It’s possible to build cities with the ecosystem in mind and progressive in the long run.

			</div>
			<div class="para3 para">
				<p>Vancouver was my home for 3 years when I returned to Canada from New Zealand. In my 3 years living there, 
				   I bar-tended at the Vancouver Convention Center (VCC) and worked at Roche Bobois. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Working as a bartender is a great way to meet people and train your memory. The functions held at VCC were most often
				   extravagant, although, smaller functions were also commonplace. To hold a proper function, the whole team needs 
				   to communicate and work together as team to be successful.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I spent over 2 years working as a warehouse and delivery manager at <a class="roche-website" href="https://www.roche-bobois.com/en-CA?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrqfq9Mbs4QIVAZJbCh1WiA40EAAYASAAEgK0gPD_BwE">Roche Bobois</a> 
				. Roche is a very high-end furniture company that prides itself on selling the highest quality furnishings.
				This is where I put my managing skills to use to bring quality and service to the job every day.</p>

				<p class="nz p">
				I travelled to New Zealand for 9 months to discover new experiences and for personal reasons. 
				This was my first time moving away from home and living in a new country. New Zealand in my 
				opinion is extremely beautiful and much like Canada. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>The culture is similar to Canada and the scenery, as well. It was also the first time that 
				   I drove on the left side of the road (watch out !).</p>
				<br>
				<p>While living in New Zealand I worked in construction (pay was better) as a drywall installer. 
				   I very quickly became the team lead and organized and 
					completed jobs to satisfy the team manager and clients. 
					Being team lead at Wakatipu Gib Fixers was my first position as a manager. The company has 
					since then disintegrated.</p>

				I worked with Winter Petroleum Ltd. (Winter) for about a year. I also worked summers at Winter on summer breaks while attending University of Calgary. 
				</p> 
				<br>
				<p>
				I worked as an Operator and looked after about a half a dozen Pumpjacks and over a hundred gas wells. I had many tasks day-to-day but one of the more 
				important was transporting water from the newly produced oil. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				I learned proper safety standards and how to take orders successfully. Operating was a hard 
				job but taught me how to work under stressful conditions safely and effectively.
